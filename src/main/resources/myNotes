I could Have Deleted the Remaining ledgers using not in list Query.
But it will be a manual JPQL so it was not deleting the child associated with Parent.
FOr example on deleting Ledger it was not deleting the payment details associated with that ledger.

That's why I had to take long way to delete them:
Still the code for deleting directly is as below;

    @Modifying
    @Query(value="DELETE from Ledger where guid not in (:ids)")
    void deleteUsersWithGuidsNotIn(@Param("ids")List<String> ids);


    In LedgerService
    List<String> updatedGUID = ledgerList.stream().map(Ledger::getGuid).collect(Collectors.toList());
    ledgerRepository.deleteUsersWithGuidsNotIn(updatedGUID);
